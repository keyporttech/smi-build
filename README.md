# smi-build

## Introduction
This repository creates a build image file for building SNIA's Storage Management Initiative (SMI) Common Information Model (CIM) Server.

## Requirements

The following must be present prior to building images.

* Docker version 19.x.x or later
* SSH keys that allow access to GitHub and the OpenPegasus repository

## How to Build the Images
Building the SMI Server image is a two step process which first requires building the build image and then the server image.  Building the build image can be skipped though if you choose to use one of the published images.

### How to Build the SMI Build Image
To build the docker image for building the SMI Server image first set the image version in the version.txt file.  Next execute the following build command.

```console
make build
```
This will lint the Dockerfile and then build the image provided no linting errors were found.

The SMI Build makefile supports the following targets.

```
make lint     Lint the Dockerfile.
make build    Build the build image.
make deploy   Deploy, push the build image to an image registry.
make clean    Remove the build image from the local machine.
```

### How to Build the SMI Server Image
Using the build image the server image can now be built.  Run the following command line.

```console
sudo docker run -it --rm -v /home/<username>/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock smi-build:tag /bin/bash
```

You will be presented with a bash command prompt with the SMI root directory as the current working directory.  At the prompt you are now able to execute the following make commands.

```
make          Same as "make all"
make all      Build and publish a server image
make build    Build the server image
make test     Run tests against the built server
make publish  Build the server, a server image and push the image to an image registry
make clean    Remove build output, build image and server images
```

"make build" : clones the current OpenPegasus project, starts a build and runs the pegasus tests against the built server.

"make publish": perform all the above build tasks plus builds an smi-server image which is presently pushed to a private image registry.

The same build tasks can also be specified on the docker command line as shown below.

```console
sudo docker run -it --rm -v /home/<username>/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock smi-build:tag "make build"
```

The container will terminate though after it finishes executing the specified command.

To only build, test and create the server image run these commands in build image bash shell.

```console
make build
make docker-build-server-image
```

The make command for the build server image will build the server image smi-server:0.1.2 on your local machine.

**Note:** At this time the tag can only be changed in the makefile.

If you wish to skip this step you can use one of the existing build images such as this one on Dockerhub.

```
peterlamanna/smi-build:0.1.0
```

## How to Run the Server Image

To run the server simply execute this command line.

```console
sudo docker run -it --rm -p 127.0.0.1:5988:5988 -p 127.0.0.1:5989:5989 smi-server:0.1.2 /bin/bash
```

or to load the server image and start OpenPegasus when the server starts enter the run command
without the last parameter ("/bin/bash")

```console
sudo docker run -it --rm -p 127.0.0.1:5988:5988 -p 127.0.0.1:5989:5989 smi-server:0.1.2
```


Again, the bash shell will have the SMI root directory as the current working directory.  From there you can execute any cimserver of cimcli command.  To start the server simply execute the following.

```console
cimserver
```

The server will start and print out to the console that it is listening on the default ports 5988 (http) and 5989 (https).
